Explaination:
1) Embeddings map words or text onto a continuous vector space where similar words are located close to each other. 
    This allows NLP models to capture semantic relationships between words, such as synonyms or related concepts. 
    For example, in a well-trained embedding space, the vectors for "king" and "queen" would be closer to each other than to unrelated words like "car" or "tree." Embeddings also provide a dense, 
    low-dimensional representation of words compared to traditional one-hot encodings. This makes them more efficient and effective as input features for machine learning models, 
    reducing the dimensionality of the input space, and improving computational efficiency.

2) Frequency penalties in language model outputs aim to discourage the repetition of tokens that have already appeared in the generated text.
              When generating text, language models may tend to produce repetitive phrases or words, which can lead to less diverse and less interesting outputs.
              By applying frequency penalties, tokens that have been used multiple times are penalized, reducing the likelihood of their repetition in subsequent generations.

3) The main advantage of using few-shot model prompting to customize a Large Language Model (LLM) is its ability to adapt the model quickly and effectively to new tasks or domains 
              with only a small amount of training data. Instead of retraining the entire model from scratch, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, few-shot prompting leverages
              the model's pre-existing knowledge.

4) The GPUs allocated for a customer’s generative AI tasks are isolated from other GPUs to maintain the security and privacy of the customer data and workloads.

5) Stop sequences, in the context of text generation, are special tokens or symbols used to signal the end of the generated text. 
            These sequences serve as markers for the model to halt its generation process. Common stop sequences include punctuation marks such as periods (.), question marks (?), and exclamation marks (!), 
            because they typically denote the end of sentences in natural language.
